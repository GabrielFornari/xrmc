XRMC example using source with direction-dependent intensity

The program "intensityscreen_image.c" produces the file with the intensity distribution on an ideal screen placed at z=15 cm and oriented perpendicularly to the z axis. The screen is divided in 100x100 pixels.
The intensity on this screen is distributed according to a two-dimensional gaussian function, with sigmax = 4 cm and sigmay = 2 cm

Compiling the program "intensityscreen_image"
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
If you are using a linux/unix platform with the gcc compiler, you can compile the program by typing the command:

./make.sh

If you are working on other platforms and/or you are not using the gcc compiler, refer to the specific instructions of the C language compiler that you are using for the compilation. After the compilation, you should see the executable:
   intensityscreen_image

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Running the simulation
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Run the intensityscreen_image program by typing:

    ./intensityscreen_image

it should produce a file called intensityscreen_image.dat
Run the simulation by typing the command:

    xrmc input.dat

The results are stored in the file "image.dat".
